## How-tos
Step-by-step guides.

### What should you try to record?

Unlike formal accounting software where you must record every transaction and account for every dollar and cent, with Gainstrack, you only need to record what is useful.

The key things to record are
1. Monthly - The account balances of your key bank accounts and investment assets

Things you should do your best to record
1. All your approximate earnings and income, both personal and from investments
2. All interbank transfers and asset purchases

Things you don't need to record
- Every single expense. Just the one off large items might be worthwhile

Things that are nice to record
- Net income is okay (i.e. gross-expenses)

### Why is it okay to only record part of one's accounts?
The goal of this software is to track your networth and explain how your networth is changing over time. To achieve this, not every single detail is required.

Account balances allow you to determine your networth at points in time

Recording transfers and asset purchases is needed to avoid spikes in your networth caused by reading account balances at times before and after the transfer

Your earnings are needed to determine your monthly/yearly income for forward planning

With all that information, your overall expenses can be determined. Any specifically measured expenses are just for your reporting granularity

By knowing your networth, income and expenses, we can forecast many things like
* Return on your investments (IRR calculation)
* How close you are to retirement
