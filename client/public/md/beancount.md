# Relationship with Beancount/Fava
## Beancount/Fava as the inspiration
Gainstrack was heavily inspired by [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount), A double-entry bookkeeping computer language that lets you define financial transaction records in a text file. It is also heavily inspired by [Fava](https://github.com/beancount/fava), which provides a web interface for Beancount.

Gainstrack aims to be more accessible and rich language for defining records than Beancount and thus provide reporting capability that far exceeds Fava. It is specifically aimed at the use case of recording personal finance and networth tracking.

Unlike beancount, Gainstrack is (currently) not suitable for maintaining precise and complete account records for business accounts or accounts suitable for tax reporting. This may change depending on demand.

## Syntax differences
It may be best to start with an example. Beancount comes with a sample file at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beancount/beancount/master/examples/simple/basic.beancount](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beancount/beancount/master/examples/simple/basic.beancount)

The gainstrack equivalent can be found at (TBD link)
