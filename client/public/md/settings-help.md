Assets can be configured to source their quotes from external sources, providing up-to-date pricing in many reports. Your sourcing options include

1. **Live ticker**
   - Directly obtain prices from a ticker source
   - Quotes and ticker names are obtained from the [quotes database](/assetdb)
   - If your ticker is not available, please contact support
2. **Live proxy**
   - Extrapolate asset prices from trade prices in your account to the future by following the market movements of another ticker
   - Particularly useful for less common funds/ETFs/assets that track a popular listed benchmark
   - Quotes and ticker names are obtained from Alpha Vantage
   - If your ticker is not available, please contact support

Assets can also be given freeform tags that will be used for upcoming features (e.g. asset allocation calculations)
